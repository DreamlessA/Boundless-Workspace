This week the majority of our time was spent exploring the Magic Leap Unity tutorials and learning the Magic Leap deployment procedure. We followed Magic Leap's documentation on how to run Unity applications via Magic Leap Remote (to accomplish zero-iteration and simulation). We investigated how event handling for the Magic Leap controller works in C# scripts. Because augmented workspaces will involve interacting with many rectangular objects in 3D space, we realized we'll need design some kind of abstraction to handle them. As such, we started designing and implementing a system of interactive UI windows (that react to click, drag,  touchpad movement, etc.). We also started working on applying images to those windows. Paul and Alan received eye prescriptions for the Magic Leap prescription lens.
