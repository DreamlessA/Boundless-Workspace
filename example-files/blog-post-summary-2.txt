We worked on a number of things this week. As far as the whiteboards/drawing aspect of our project is concerned, we resolved some issues we were having with textures not looking right. On the networking side of things, we figured out how to transfer files from a PC over the internet and onto the Magic Leap headset. We also worked on text display this week. Currently, the text can be displayed in a reasonable font size that is similar to the size of text on an actual piece of paper. There is also a white background behind the text, and the text color is black. Finally, we worked on collision detection this week. Specifically, we were trying to figure a way for the windows to interact with physical planes. We got the collision detection part working with the use of kinematic colliders and rigidbodies.
